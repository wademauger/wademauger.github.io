# Authentication Improvements Summary

## Problem Statement

The application had several authentication issues:

1. **Session Expiry Not Handled**: When a browser session sat idle, the authentication token would expire and API calls would fail. Users had to refresh the page to re-authenticate, losing ephemeral app state.

2. **User Profile Info Lost**: The login button sometimes showed "Account" instead of the user's name because:
   - User profile info was only in localStorage, not cached
   - If profile fetch failed, no fallback was available
   - No mapping from email to cached profile info

3. **Reactive vs Proactive Auth**: The system only detected auth failures when API calls failed, rather than proactively checking before making calls.

## Solution Overview

### 1. User Profile Cache (`userProfileCache.ts`)

A new utility that:
- Stores user profiles (email, name, picture) in both sessionStorage and localStorage
- Provides 7-day cache lifetime
- Allows fallback when API calls fail
- Maps email addresses to profile information

**Key Features:**
- `storeProfile(email, name, picture)` - Cache a user profile
- `getProfile(email)` - Retrieve cached profile
- `getAllProfiles()` - Get all cached profiles (excluding expired)
- Automatic expiration after 7 days
- Dual storage (sessionStorage for speed, localStorage for persistence)

### 2. Proactive Token Validation

Enhanced all Google Drive services with:

**New Methods:**
- `isTokenExpired()` - Lightweight check if token is expired/expiring (2min buffer)
- `ensureValidToken()` - Validate and refresh token if needed before API calls

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `withAutoAuth()` - Now proactively checks token before operations
- `validateToken()` - Improved to update session with fresh user data
- `loadUserProfile()` - Falls back to cache on failure
- `saveSession()` - Caches user profile when saving
- `restoreSession()` - Augments missing user info from cache

### 3. GoogleAuthButton Improvements

Updated `GoogleAuthButton.tsx` to:
- Import and use `userProfileCache`
- Fall back to cached user info when services don't provide it
- Display cached profile even when auth API is temporarily unavailable

### 4. Cross-Service Consistency

Applied improvements to all Google Drive services:
- `GoogleDriveServiceModern.ts` (Songs app)
- `GoogleDriveRecipeService.ts` (Recipes app)  
- `GoogleDriveService.ts` (Legacy service)

## Technical Details

### Token Expiry Check Flow

```
API Operation Request
    ↓
withAutoAuth() wrapper
    ↓
isTokenExpired() check
    ↓ (if expired/expiring)
ensureValidToken()
    ↓
validateToken() [API call]
    ↓
loadUserProfile() [with cache fallback]
    ↓
saveSession() [caches profile]
    ↓
Proceed with operation
```

### Profile Cache Flow

```
Sign In
    ↓
loadUserProfile() [API call]
    ↓
storeProfile() [cache in session+local]
    ↓
    
Later: Profile Fetch Fails
    ↓
getProfile() [from cache]
    ↓
Display cached info
```

### Session Restoration Flow

```
Page Load
    ↓
restoreSession()
    ↓
Check localStorage for token/email
    ↓
If token valid but missing name/picture
    ↓
getProfile(email) [from cache]
    ↓
Augment session with cached data
```

## Benefits

1. **No Data Loss on Re-auth**: Ephemeral app state survives because re-authentication happens transparently without page refresh

2. **Always Show User Info**: Profile name and picture display even when:
   - API call fails
   - Network is temporarily unavailable
   - Token is expired but email is known

3. **Proactive vs Reactive**: Token expiry is detected 2 minutes before actual expiry, allowing graceful refresh

4. **Better UX**: Users see their profile info immediately on page load from cache

5. **Resilient**: System continues to work with cached data during temporary API failures

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite for `userProfileCache`:
- 12 tests covering all scenarios
- 89.83% code coverage
- Tests for storage, retrieval, expiration, fallback

See `AUTHENTICATION_TESTING.md` for manual testing instructions.

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing localStorage keys remain unchanged
- New cache is additive (doesn't replace existing storage)
- Falls back gracefully if cache is empty

### Data Migration

No migration needed - cache builds up naturally as users sign in.

### Client ID Requirements

No changes to OAuth scopes or client ID configuration required.

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
1. Add `refreshToken()` method using Google's refresh token flow
2. Implement automatic background token refresh before expiry
3. Add analytics to track auth failure rates
4. Store auth state in Redux for global consistency
5. Add service worker for offline profile caching
