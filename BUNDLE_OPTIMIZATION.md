# Bundle Splitting Optimizations Summary

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting with React.lazy()
- **Landing Page**: Uses minimal layout with only essential components
- **Heavy Components**: All major app components are lazy-loaded:
  - Layout component (with Redux state and ChordChart)
  - HomePage, RecipesApp, SongTabsApp, KnittingApp, KnittingDesignApp
  - NotFound page

### 2. Bundle Structure
- **Main Bundle**: Contains landing page + React core (~350KB)
- **Lazy Chunks**: Separate bundles for each app section (3KB - 521KB each)
- **Landing Page Bundle**: Minimal dependencies for fastest initial load

### 3. Resource Optimization
- **DNS Prefetching**: For external resources (Gravatar, Google APIs, CDNs)
- **Resource Preloading**: Critical landing page image preloaded
- **Critical CSS**: Inline CSS for landing page to prevent flash
- **Service Worker**: Caching for production builds

### 4. Route-Based Prefetching
- **RoutePreloader**: Prefetches likely next routes on hover
- **Intelligent Loading**: Different chunks loaded based on user navigation intent

### 5. Minimal Landing Layout
- **Separate Layout**: Landing page bypasses heavy Layout component
- **Reduced Dependencies**: No Redux state, no ChordChart, no Antd components on initial load

## Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization:
- Single large bundle with all dependencies
- Landing page loads all app components immediately
- Heavy Layout component with Redux required for home page

### After Optimization:
- **Faster Initial Load**: Landing page loads only essential code
- **Progressive Loading**: Additional features load on-demand
- **Better Caching**: Separate chunks enable better cache utilization
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Main bundle significantly smaller

## Bundle Analysis
Use `npm run build:analyze` to see detailed bundle composition and size analysis.

## Deployment
The optimizations work automatically with:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

All optimizations are compatible with GitHub Pages and don't require server-side changes.
