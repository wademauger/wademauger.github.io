# Interactive Knitting UX - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the Interactive Knitting View component to meet the requirements specified in the issue.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Transition from Settings to Knitting View
- Users can click "Start Knitting" or "Next" buttons to transition from the design/settings view to the interactive knitting view
- This is handled by the `ColorworkPanelEditor` component which manages the stage state

### 2. Text Instructions for Current Row
- The current row displays detailed text instructions including:
  - Shaping information (stitch counts, left/right distribution)
  - Colorwork pattern segments with color labels and stitch counts
  - Visual colorwork pattern representation

### 3. Row Navigation
- **Previous Row**: Users can step back to review previous rows using the "Prev" button
- **Next Row**: Users can advance to the next row using the "Next" or "Done" buttons
- Navigation maintains completion status tracking

### 4. Panel Shape Visualization
- The panel shape is displayed showing all rows
- **Current row is highlighted with a red line** (as specified in the issue)
- Completed rows are shown in green
- Remaining rows are shown in gray
- Each row's width corresponds to its stitch count, creating a visual representation of the panel shape

### 5. Shaping Row Indicators
- **NEW**: Rows that require shaping (increases or decreases) are flagged with a warning indicator
- An orange/yellow alert box displays "Shaping Row" with the message "This row requires increases or decreases"
- The system automatically detects shaping by comparing stitch counts between consecutive rows

### 6. Colorwork Display Modes
- **NEW**: Toggle between two display modes for colorwork patterns:
  - **Pattern Mode** (default): Shows the repeating pattern with edges visible
  - **Full Row Mode**: Shows the entire row in a horizontally scrollable area
- Users can switch between modes using radio buttons above the colorwork visualization

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### `src/components/InteractiveKnittingView.tsx`
- Added `colorworkDisplayMode` state to track display mode ('repeating' or 'fullRow')
- Added `hasShaping()` helper function to detect rows with increases/decreases
- Added `Alert` component to flag shaping rows
- Added `Radio.Group` for colorwork display mode toggle
- Updated `PanelRowHighlight` component to use red highlighting for current row
- Updated `ColorworkRowBar` component to support both display modes with horizontal scrolling

#### `src/components/ColorworkPanelEditor.tsx`
- Added `handleRowBack()` callback function for backward navigation
- Passed `onRowBack` prop to `InteractiveKnittingView`

### Key Components

#### Shaping Detection
```typescript
const hasShaping = (rowIndex) => {
    if (!enhancedStitchPlan || rowIndex === 0) return false;
    
    const currentRow = enhancedStitchPlan.rows[rowIndex];
    const previousRow = enhancedStitchPlan.rows[rowIndex - 1];
    
    if (!currentRow || !previousRow) return false;
    
    const currentTotal = currentRow.leftStitchesInWork + currentRow.rightStitchesInWork;
    const previousTotal = previousRow.leftStitchesInWork + previousRow.rightStitchesInWork;
    
    return currentTotal !== previousTotal;
};
```

#### Colorwork Display Mode Toggle
```tsx
<Radio.Group 
    size="small" 
    value={colorworkDisplayMode}
    onChange={(e) => setColorworkDisplayMode(e.target.value)}
>
    <Radio.Button value="repeating">Pattern</Radio.Button>
    <Radio.Button value="fullRow">Full Row</Radio.Button>
</Radio.Group>
```

#### Red Line Current Row Highlight
```tsx
{index === currentRow && (
    <div
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: '50%',
            left: 0,
            right: 0,
            height: '2px',
            backgroundColor: '#ff0000',
            transform: 'translateY(-50%)',
            zIndex: 1
        }}
    />
)}
```

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. User designs a panel with colorwork patterns in the settings view
2. User clicks "Start Knitting" to enter interactive knitting mode
3. User sees the current row highlighted in red on the panel visualization
4. If the current row requires shaping, a warning indicator appears
5. User can toggle between pattern and full row colorwork display modes
6. User can navigate forward with "Next"/"Done" or backward with "Prev"
7. Progress is tracked and displayed as a percentage
8. User can return to settings at any time with "Back to Settings"

## Build and Testing

- Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- No new linting errors introduced
- Changes are minimal and focused on the requirements
- All modifications are backward compatible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add keyboard shortcuts for row navigation (arrow keys)
- Add row notes/annotations feature
- Export instructions as PDF
- Add audio cues for row transitions
- Support for multiple colorwork techniques (fair isle, intarsia, etc.)
