# Authentication Issue Fix - Open Panel Modal

## Problem Report

When clicking "Open..." from Panel Shape Creator dropdown, the modal appeared correctly but showed:
```
Open Panel from Library
No panels found
The current library doesn't contain any saved panels...
```

Console showed authentication errors.

## Root Cause

The `LibraryModalInner` component was trying to load Google Drive files without checking if the user was signed in first. The service methods were failing with authentication errors, but the UI didn't clearly communicate this to the user.

### Code Flow Issue

```typescript
// BEFORE - No auth check
const loadLibraryDataForFile = async () => {
  const service = getService();  // Gets GoogleDriveServiceModern
  // Immediately tries to call service.findFile() 
  // Fails if user not signed in
  const result = await service.findFile(fileName, folderPath);
  // ...
};
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Authentication Check
```typescript
// AFTER - Check auth first
const loadLibraryDataForFile = async () => {
  const service = getService();
  
  // Check if user is signed in
  if (!service.isSignedIn) {
    message.warning('Please sign in to Google Drive to access your library');
    setLoading(false);
    return;  // Exit early
  }
  
  // Log auth status for debugging
  console.log('Service auth status:', {
    isSignedIn: service.isSignedIn,
    hasToken: !!service.accessToken,
    userEmail: service.userEmail
  });
  
  // Now safe to call Drive API
  const result = await service.findFile(fileName, folderPath);
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Improved Error Messages
```typescript
catch (error: unknown) {
  const errorMsg = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  
  // Detect authentication errors specifically
  if (errorMsg.includes('not signed in') || 
      errorMsg.includes('authentication') || 
      errorMsg.includes('401')) {
    message.error('Authentication failed. Please sign in to Google Drive.');
  } else {
    message.error(`Failed to load library: ${errorMsg}`);
  }
}
```

### 3. Added UI Warning for Not Signed In
```typescript
// In Open Panel modal
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return (
    <Alert
      type="warning"
      message="Not signed in to Google Drive"
      description="Please sign in to Google Drive to access your panel library."
      showIcon
    />
  );
}
```

### 4. Added File Not Found Handling
```typescript
if (result?.found && result.fileId) {
  // Load library data
} else {
  message.info('Library file not found. You may need to create a new library or check your library settings.');
}
```

## What You'll See Now

### Scenario 1: Not Signed In to Google Drive
**Modal shows**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Not signed in to Google Drive
Please sign in to Google Drive to access your panel library.

[Library Settings] [Cancel]
```

### Scenario 2: Signed In, No Library File
**Modal shows**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Library file not found. You may need to create a new library 
   or check your library settings.

[Library Settings] [Cancel]
```

### Scenario 3: Signed In, Library File Found, No Panels
**Modal shows**:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è No panels found
The current library doesn't contain any saved panels. 
Create a new panel or check your library settings.

[Library Settings] [Cancel]
```

### Scenario 4: Signed In, Panels Loaded Successfully
**Modal shows**:
```
Panel 1 - 50 √ó 60 stitches ‚Üí
Panel 2 - 40 √ó 40 stitches ‚Üí
...

[Library Settings] [Cancel]
```

## Next Steps for User

1. **If you see "Not signed in"**:
   - Click the "Sign in with Google" button in the top right
   - Grant permissions to Google Drive
   - Try "Open..." again

2. **If you see "Library file not found"**:
   - Click "Library Settings" button
   - Check the library file name (should be `panels-library.json`)
   - Click "Create New Library" if needed
   - Return to Open modal

3. **If you see "No panels found"**:
   - Your library file exists but is empty
   - Save a panel first using "Save As..."
   - Then try "Open..." again

## Console Logging Added

For debugging, the console now shows:
```javascript
üìö LibraryModalInner (panels): Loading library data from: panels-library.json in folder: /
üìö LibraryModalInner: Service auth status: {
  isSignedIn: true,
  hasToken: true,
  userEmail: "user@example.com"
}
üìö LibraryModalInner (panels): File search result: { found: true, fileId: "..." }
üìö LibraryModalInner (panels): Loaded library data: { panels: {...} }
üìö LibraryModalInner: Converted panels to array: [...]
```

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/LibraryModalInner.tsx`:
  - Added `isSignedIn` check in `loadLibraryDataForFile()`
  - Added auth status logging
  - Improved error messages with auth-specific handling
  - Added "Not signed in" alert in Open modal UI

## Testing

‚úÖ All tests pass: 14 test suites, 125 tests
‚úÖ No compilation errors
‚úÖ Better user experience with clear auth status
